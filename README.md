### The SecondAttempt.ipynb file is the main file for the code
soft_cross_entropy_version.ipynb uses costomed cross-entropy function for soft label. This file is still under development.

### Other .ipynb files are supporting files
preprocessing.ipynb: This file is to preprocess the dataset. <br>
remove_outliers.ipynb: This file is to remove the empty images in the dataset. <br>
statistics.ipynb: This file is to draw statistics of the dataset. <br>
curve.ipynb: This file is to draw curves based on data. <br>
cp_part.ipynb: This file to generate a smaller dataset in order to debug the code more quickly <br>

### Data
